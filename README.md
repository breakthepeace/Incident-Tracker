This is rewrited to Materialize CSS project from tutorial 'Pure JavaScript — Building A Real-World Application From Scratch', which you can find here: https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/pure-javascript-building-a-real-world-application-from-scratch-5213591cfcd6.

By making this application I've learned to create UI using Materialize CSS, also learned how to use localStorage in vanilla JavaScript.
